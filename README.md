Here are the JetPack Compose excercises.

## Topic 4
# How to start using Compose
In this branch we should create the proyect in Android Studio, called "Basics Codelab", this name is assigned by the same page of JetPack Compose. Here they explain how to create the proyect and we should know the basic sintaxys of Kotlin, we create the proyect using the option "Empty Activity" and they explain the starting point in the proyect, that is MainActivity.kt. We can run the proyect in a devices like cellphones or a virtual machine. And finally in the screen we seen the example "Hello Android!" and thats it for now.

# How to adjust the UI
In this case we learn how to adjust the User Experience, in the page explains what is the material theme, and the text and surfaces, in the @Compose we add a text, surface and primary color. Also I learn how to use the modifier padding (in this case is 24.dp)
