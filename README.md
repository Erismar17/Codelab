Here are the JetPack Compose exercises.

# Codelab 1
# Topic 4
## How to start using Compose
In this branch we should create the proyect in Android Studio, called "Basics Codelab", this name is assigned by the same page of JetPack Compose. Here they explain how to create the proyect and we should know the basic sintaxys of Kotlin, we create the proyect using the option "Empty Activity" and they explain the starting point in the proyect, that is MainActivity.kt. We can run the proyect in a devices like cellphones or a virtual machine. And finally in the screen we seen the example "Hello Android!" and thats it for now.

## How to adjust the UI
In this case we learn how to adjust the User Experience, in the page explains what is the material theme, and the text and surfaces, in the @Compose we add a text, surface and primary color. Also I learn how to use the modifier padding (in this case is 24.dp)

## How reuse composable elements
If you have more components more nesting you´ll have. A composability element called "MyApp" must be created where it contains a greeting.

## How to create colums and rows
Here I learn how to use the padding, actually, how to move the padding (with numbers) and add to add columns and rows for diference the code. In the padding the vertical and horizontal is for like the space they have. And we put a bottom for see more, or less in the rows.

## Been in composition
Here you can simply see how to expand the button and change its expansion state

## Elevation of status
In this part of the activity we have to create a previous window before entering the application as such, called "On-boarding"

## Create a performance deferred list
Here we only add a line of code write the limit of the columns for the list.

## Persistent state & How animate your list
In "how to animate your list" you can learn the different animations that can be done with low-level APIs, this code is only implemented in the Greeting function " var shouldShowOnboarding by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(true) }"

## How to apply styling and themes to your app
Here they teach how to apply styles and design to the application using theme material tools, such as titles, fonts and sizes.

## Final touches
Here some dependencies are implemented and we use string type resources to display more text.
